									<p>If you landed here it (probably) means you are interested in something I made, so let me introduce myself:
										I am Valentino C., currently a student
										attending a random college located in Portugal. I love building new software, as you will find out, but 
										also have an interest in electronics and science (you know, just science  at its purest definition).
										I describe myself as a maker and thinker, and problem solving in on my list.
										My toolbox is interesting, so I invite you to scroll down by my website. If you only want my curriculum,
										here it is, but only in Portuguese: <a href="curriculum.pdf"><span class="label"> 
											curriculum</span></a>.

												<h4>Chaimager</h4>
												<p> An app built fully in python with Tkinter for the GUI. It allows a user to modify 
													automatically a PDF, adding images next to all the ocurrences of a particular name, so that
													you may recall easier who is the character the author was talking about. Check it out in 
													my old website page.</p> <a href="ChaiMager Project.html"><span class="label">

												<h4>Priser</h4>
												<p> Web platform made with Django and using Bootstrap that worked like a marketplace for 3D printing.
													The users who wanted to print something and did not have a 3D printer, could easily find
													someone willing to print it for them, for a price. This way, a lot of money could be saved for 
													those users who just needed to print something once in a while. Project was closed because of the 
													lack of users.

												<h4>Automated Radio Telescope and hydrogen line observation</h4>
												<p> With the main goal of colecting info from the hydrogen line and compute is spinning velocity, I built my own radio telescope.
													 Thanks to motors, it moves by itself, covering the entire visible sky, everything controlled by computer. 
													 This way, collecting information is easy, and I can let it work all the night and collect the data in the morning! 
													 I joined a science contest with this project in High school (completely alone) and got a Honor mention.
													 For more informations on the building process, visit the Instructables page. 
													 Check my report made with the data I collected as well.</p>

												<h4>Voice chess,
													a Chess Board With Voice Commands</h4>
												<p> For all people with incapabilities (or just for the lazy guys), this board allows to play chess without hands. Using google´s funcionality that translates the voice to text, the commands of the movement are sent for the controller, that moves the pieces (and even remove them when they are killed) using a magnet. For more informations about the building, code, etc, check the Instructables page of the project. It was covered on medium.com, hackaday and tons of others websites!

												<p>When someone is walking next to it, a PIR triggers, making the light bulb to glow, and the arms to move. A "owowowow" sound is also produced using columns. Perfect to scare people at night, on a spot with lack of light, during halloween. </p>

												<h4>Tons of reddit bots</h4>
												<p> Some of them worth noting are: Sxtybot, with the purpose of removing any posts that are not a video with a specific lenght and send a message to the user who posted it.
												SummriZlor, with the goal of making a summary using the summry API from all the posts present in a specific subreddit.
												Flotbot, that picks the data from the requested soccer match in the fotmob website ands sends it to a reddit thread, thats is constantly being updated during the match.  </p>
